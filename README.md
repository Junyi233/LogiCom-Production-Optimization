# LogiCom-Production-Optimization
**Title:** Maximizing Monthly Profit for Computer Production at LogiCom

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on providing LogiCom, the world's largest manufacturer of technological devices, with optimization solutions to enhance its monthly profit in the competitive market of computer production. With increased market competition leading to price reductions and reduced profit margins, LogiCom seeks to achieve maximum profitability. 

The project comprises two main components:

**Part A: Lean Manufacturing Implementation**
In Part A, lean manufacturing practices are implemented to optimize LogiCom's production efficiency. This involves strategically rearranging working stations and labor allocation to streamline the production process, minimize waste, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

**Part B: Profit Optimization**
Building upon the results of labor and station allocation optimization in Part A, Part B focuses on further enhancing LogiCom's profit margins. The profit optimization strategy considers factors such as production efficiency, cost reduction, and pricing strategies to maximize monthly profits in the competitive technological device market.

**Project Deliverables:**

1. Comprehensive analysis of LogiCom's current production process, including identified areas for improvement.
2. Lean manufacturing implementation plan, including recommendations for station and labor allocation.
3. Profit optimization strategy outlining pricing, cost reduction, and efficiency improvement recommendations.
4. Data analysis and modeling results showcasing the projected increase in monthly profit.
5. Detailed report summarizing the project findings, recommendations, and the potential impact on LogiCom's profitability.
